I hard coded the data into the Vuex store. If it were used in production I would implement a method that pulls the data from the API. My transaction component has pending charges and available charges so the user would know how much additional money they can spend. I only have subtracted values from the balance and if if I were to take more time I would add functionality for a 'credit' type transaction to increase the avaialable balance (ie when a customer gets a refund for something). With more time I would also make the layout look cleaner and format the purchase data appropriatley.
